# Track 1: General-Purpose AI Agent

## What you are building
An AI agent that handles a wide variety of natural language tasks across multiple capability domains, using Fireworks AI models as efficiently as possible.

## Capability categories
Your agent will be evaluated across all eight categories. Build for all of them:

| # | Category | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Factual knowledge | Explaining concepts, definitions, and how things work |
| 2 | Mathematical reasoning | Multi-step arithmetic, percentages, word problems, projections |
| 3 | Sentiment classification | Labelling sentiment and justifying the classification |
| 4 | Text summarisation | Condensing passages to a specific format or length constraint |
| 5 | Named entity recognition | Extracting and labelling entities (person, org, location, date) |
| 6 | Code debugging | Identifying bugs in code snippets and providing corrected implementations |
| 7 | Logical / deductive reasoning | Constraint-based puzzles where all conditions must be satisfied |
| 8 | Code generation | Writing correct, well-structured functions from a spec |

## What to submit
A Docker image pushed to a public registry (e.g. GitHub Container Registry, Docker Hub).
Check out the Image Architecture requirement at the bottom of this document

Your container must:
1. Read tasks from `/input/tasks.json` on startup
```json
[
  {"task_id": "t1", "prompt": "Summarise the following text in one sentence: ..."},
  { "task_id": "t2", "prompt": "..." }
]
```

2. Write results to `/output/results.json` before exiting
```json
[
  { 
    "task_id": "t1",
    "answer": "..."
  },
  { 
    "task_id": "t2",
    "answer": "..."
  }
]
```

## Environment variables
The harness injects these at runtime. Read them from the environment: do not hardcode values or bundle a `.env` file in your image.

```python
import os
api_key   = os.environ["FIREWORKS_API_KEY"] # provided by harness do not use your own
base_url  = os.environ["FIREWORKS_BASE_URL"] # route ALL Fireworks calls through this URL
models    = os.environ["ALLOWED_MODELS"].split(",") # exact model IDs published on launch day
```

For local development you can use a .env file, but your submitted container must read these purely from the environment: the harness will inject the real values at evaluation time.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| FIREWORKS_API_KEY | Provided by the harness - use this key, not your own |
| FIREWORKS_BASE_URL | Base URL for all Fireworks API calls must be used to configure your client |
| ALLOWED_MODELS | Comma-separated list of permitted Fireworks AI model IDs, published on launch day |

**Important:** All API calls must go through `FIREWORKS_BASE_URL`. Calls that bypass this URL will not be recorded and the submission will score zero tokens. Do not hardcode model IDs: read from `ALLOWED_MODELS` at runtime.

## Rules
* Exit code 0 on success, non-zero on failure
* Maximum runtime: 10 minutes
* Only models in `ALLOWED_MODELS` are permitted, calls to other models invalidate the submission
* `/output/results.json` must be valid JSON, malformed output scores zero
* Local models and tokens used locally count as zero for the final score; all inference must go through Fireworks AI via `FIREWORKS_BASE_URL`
* Do not hardcode or cache answers; evaluation uses unseen prompt variants
* Image compressed size must not exceed 10GB larger images are rejected before pulling
* Submissions are rate-limited to 10 per hour per team

## Scoring
1. **Accuracy gate:** LLM-Judge evaluates each answer against the expected intent. Submissions below the accuracy threshold are excluded from the leaderboard.
2. **Token efficiency:** submissions that pass the accuracy gate are ranked ascending by total tokens recorded by the judging proxy. Fewer tokens = higher rank.

---

## General rules (all tracks)
* Your container must start and be ready within 60 seconds
* Response time per request must be under 30 seconds
* All responses must be in English
* Do not hardcode or cache answers to specific inputs evaluation uses unseen variants
* Container images must be publicly pullable at submission time

## Image architecture requirement
The judging VM runs `linux/amd64`. Your image must include a `linux/amd64` manifest or it will fail to pull and score zero.

If you build on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3), add `--platform linux/amd64` to your build command:
```shell
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -tag your-image:latest --push
```
Standard `linux/amd64` builds (e.g. built on Intel/AMD or GitHub Actions) are fine without any changes.
